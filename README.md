### Project Overview
---
The dataset includes transactional details such as order ID, date, product, category, price, quantity, total sales, customer information, payment method, and order status. The goal is to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and operational insights to support decision-making.
Key fields include:

- Customer Locations: Various USA cities such as New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Miami, and others

### Method and Tools 
---
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, standardize date formats, and categorize order statuses.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to understand distribution of sales across products, categories, months, and regions.

- Data Visualization: Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards and visual reports to highlight key metrics such as total sales, order status distribution, and top-performing products.

### Insight and Findings
---
- Sales Trends: March 2025 recorded the highest sales volume and revenue compared to February and April, indicating a peak sales period.

- Top Categories: Electronics led in total sales, with laptops, smartphones, and smartwatches being the most popular products.

- Order Status: A significant portion of orders were either Pending or Cancelled, especially in categories like Home Appliances and Footwear, suggesting potential issues in order fulfillment or customer decision changes.

- Payment Methods: Debit Card and PayPal were the most frequently used payment methods, with Gift Cards also popular but associated with a higher cancellation rate.

- Geographical Insights: Major cities like New York, San Francisco, and Dallas showed the highest sales volumes, indicating strong market demand in these urban centers.

- Customer Behavior: Repeat customers such as Emma Clark and Olivia Wilson contributed substantially to sales, especially in Electronics and Footwear.
  
### Conclusion
--- 
The analysis reveals that Electronics is the dominant category driving revenue, with March as a critical month for sales. However, the high rate of Pending and Cancelled orders points to operational challenges that could impact customer satisfaction and revenue realization. Payment method preferences and regional sales concentrations offer valuable insights for targeted marketing and inventory management.

### Recommendation
---
- Focus Marketing Efforts: Target high-performing cities with personalized promotions to capitalize on existing demand.

- Enhance Payment Options: Encourage use of reliable payment methods like Debit Card and PayPal while addressing issues related to Gift Card transactions.

- Inventory Optimization: Align stock levels with peak sales periods, especially in March, to meet customer demand efficiently.

### Limitations
---
- The dataset covers only a three-month period, limiting the ability to analyze long-term trends.

- Order status data does not provide reasons for cancellations or delays, restricting deeper operational insights.
